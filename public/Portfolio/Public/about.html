    <h2>Passions and goals</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Web Developer, and I am currently studying at the App Brewery's Web Development Bootcamp.<br />
        I am passionate about coding and I am looking forward to learning more about it.<br />
        My goal is to become a Full Stack Developer and work in an Asian country like Japan or South Korea in the future.<br />
        I am now working working in Teleperformance as my first real job, and in the meanwhile I am studying to become a Web Developer.<br />
        As a first job, I think that it was quite  step for me to move from a little countyside in the south of Italy to a big city like Lisbon all alone for the first time.<br />
